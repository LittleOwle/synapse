## Motivation
#### After testing several workspace solutions for Node.js, [@jamilservicos](https://github.com/jamilservicos) couldn't find one that fully met his needs.
#### After customizing multiple existing solutions, he decided to create his own to better suit his requirements.
#### Realizing that others might have the same needs, he chose to develop a public version and share his creation.

## Release Process
#### The public version will be gradually released, contributing to the learning process of some junior developers.
#### Initially, all documentation will be made available in parts and in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR). The final version will only be published after evaluating the results in developing logical thinking among juniors.
#### Once the training is complete, the system will be 100% online, and the full documentation will also be available in American English (en-US).
#### The final version of the documentation may include contributions from participants if relevant suggestions are made.
#### The English translation will be carried out by artificial intelligence after the release process is completed.
#### Questions should only be addressed via private messages on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamilservicos/). This repository will remain the official project repository, and the **issues section should not be used for study-related questions**.
#### The project will only be open to contributions once it is fully released. Any contribution attempts before that will be rejected, as the project will not yet be finalized.
